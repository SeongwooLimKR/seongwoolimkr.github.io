I’m a postdoctoral researcher in <a href='https://sail.kaist.ac.kr'>SAIL</a> at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) under the supervision of Prof. Jaesik Choi. I am interested in explainable AI that clarifies how models make decisions, as well as in efficient inference in symbolic model.
